/*
Youâ€™ll notice that sometimes the system will print "File successfully opened and closed." first and then "Fusce convallis metus id felis luctus adipiscing."  was printed. 
This is due to cerr being unbuffered, which means it gets printed immediately. 
cout is buffered, so it will store its content into memory before printing, which explains the delay.
*/

/*
The reason why only one line of text was printed is because getline() only reads up until a newline character is reached. 
To continue to read more lines of text, wrap getline() inside a while loop.
